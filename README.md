# Chicken-Translator
Description: Simple code to translate chicken code into their more readable op codes. 
Input must me correctly formated when copied in.
When going from op codes to chicken op codes must be formated as such
exit
chicken
add
subtract
multiply
compare
load
store
jump
char
push n (n being the integer value you want to push to the stack. Note the number of chickens, 10 chickens will be added)

There are still bugs and chicken code copied in and changed to op code and then changed back to chicken will not run in the interpreter.
